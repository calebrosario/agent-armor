# This folder stores app-specific settings, workspace layouts, plugin data, and cache.

# If you want to version control your vault settings,
# you can include this folder in git, but be careful about:
# - workspace.json (contains window positions)
# - plugins/ (large plugin files)

# Recommended: Only version control:
# - app.json (app settings)
# - appearance.json (theme settings)
# - hotkeys.json (custom hotkeys)
# - templates/ (your templates)

# Ignore:
# - workspace.json
# - workspace-mobile.json  
# - graph.json
# - plugins/*/main.js (large files)
# - plugins/*/styles.css
# - cache/
