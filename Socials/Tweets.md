### Option 1: Problem/Solution
```
Tired of losing your entire coding session when OpenCode/Claude Code crashes? 😤

I built a plugin that automatically checks if Entire CLI is enabled—and nags you until you fix it.

Works with OpenCode AND Claude Code. Never lose context again.

That moment when your AI coding session crashes and you lose 2 hours of context... 💀

Just dropped opencode-auto-entire: a plugin that monitors your memory stack and screams at you if Entire CLI isn't enabled.
