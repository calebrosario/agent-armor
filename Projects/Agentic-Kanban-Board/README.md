## 🆚 Why Agentic Kanban Board vs Direct CLI?

### Enhanced CLI Experience
Claude Code CLI is excellent for single-focus coding sessions. However, when managing complex projects with multiple contexts, some additional capabilities become valuable:
- **Concurrent Development** - Working on multiple features or projects simultaneously
- **Session Organization** - Organizing conversations by project goals and development stages
- **Agent Workflow** - Streamlined switching between different AI specializations
- **Visual Management** - Web interface for better session overview and navigation


### Workflow Comparison

**Traditional CLI Workflow** 😤
```
1. Open project directory
2. Launch cmd/terminal window
3. Enter Claude Code CLI command
4. Input commands and wait for completion
5. With multiple projects: hunt for the right terminal window
6. Difficult to run multiple session with same project at the same time
```

**Agentic Kanban Board Workflow** 🚀
```
1. Create new session directly in web interface
2. Select project directory and Agent with one click
3. Launch multiple conversations for same project effortlessly
4. Cross-session continuity: build upon previous conversations
5. Clear completion notifications when tasks finish
6. Intuitive interface: see all session status at a glance
7. Instant switching: click to enter any conversation
8. Concurrent management: handle multiple projects seamlessly
```
