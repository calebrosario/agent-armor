ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Key Differentiators:
1. Real-time vs. Batch: Plural/OpenStates provide real-time; most others are batch-based
2. Standardization: Plural/OpenStates offer cross-state standardization; state APIs vary wildly
3. Maintenance: Open source requires you to maintain it; hosted services handle maintenance
4. Data Completeness: Premium services (LegiScan, BillTrack50) often have more complete data
5. Legal Use: Review terms of service, especially for commercial applications
Recommendation Strategy:
- Start with Plural Open Data for comprehensive state coverage
- Add Open States Scrapers if you need customization
- Supplement with state-specific official APIs for critical states
- Use BillTrack50's free tier for searches before committing to paid plans
